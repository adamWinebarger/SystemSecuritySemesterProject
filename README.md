# SystemSecuritySemesterProject

This project looks to examine practical applications of various cryptographic schemes into real-world (WPF) applications.

Prior to this project, I created a project for another class that made use an a Symmetric (AES) encrpytion scheme in which data was encrypted using a shared secret key stored within the source code of said project and decrypted using the same key but stored on a detachable USB thumb drive. While better than nothing, it meant that someone who knew where to look within the source code of a project could pretty easily figure out what the key used to decrypt was and what would needed to be done to create a passable fake decryption key. 

In changing this project's cryptographic scheme to something asymmetric, we can make the encryption scheme more secure as the keys used to encrypt and decrypt will be different - meaning that knowledge of the public key stored within the source files will not allow an adversarial party to decrypt encrypted files on the machine. Furthermore, we could make security on the application even more robust by either using AES to encrypt our public and private key values, or simply use an asymmetric scheme to encrypt the AES key - although the latter may pose an issue since there would have to be some way to decrypt the encryption key on the device itself; meaning there would be a way for an attacker to figure out the key needed to decrypt files.

In addition, one of the other major shortcomings of the previously mentioned project was the fact that it would attempt to decrypt using any file called "Key.txt" on a detachable medium - leading to the program crashing in the event that the contents of key.txt was not the key needed to decrypt. So in order to counteract this, some sort of hashing/signature scheme seems like it would be useful. At the time of writing this, the rough scheme I'm thinking of right now is storing a hashed value of the public key on a corresponding private key thumb-drive and using that as a check to ensure that the public and private keys correspond.
